This ZIP file contains the raw Kaggle dataset used for the flight delay prediction project.
It includes monthly flight data from May to December 2019, each as a separate CSV file:
05-2019.csv
06-2019.csv
07-2019.csv
08-2019.csv
09-2019.csv
10-2019.csv
11-2019.csv
12-2019.csv
Each CSV file records flight information such as:
DATE, AIRLINE, ORIGIN, DEST, DEPARTURE_DELAY, ARRIVAL_DELAY, etc.
These datasets are the source data used for cleaning, merging, and feature generation in the model.
