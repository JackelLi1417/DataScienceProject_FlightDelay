This is the group project studying the relationship between flight delays and weather conditions. It is conducted by the student group (group 6) from COMSCI 526 course (2025 Fall term) at Duke University.

This ZIP file contains the raw Kaggle dataset used for the flight delay prediction project.
It includes monthly flight data from May to December 2019, each as a separate CSV file:
05-2019.csv
06-2019.csv
07-2019.csv
08-2019.csv
09-2019.csv
10-2019.csv
11-2019.csv
12-2019.csv
Each CSV file records flight information such as:
DATE, AIRLINE, ORIGIN, DEST, DEPARTURE_DELAY, ARRIVAL_DELAY, etc.
These datasets are the source data used for cleaning, merging, and feature generation in the model.
